I used the javascript code from this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydZc17rlR5E&ab_channel=FlorinPop The reason I chose to use this javascript is because we have not covered it yet, but it looks much better than the checkbox hack and is something I would look to learn to do in the future.
